<h2>Chocolate Fruit Cake</h2>
<p>Chocolate cake with strawberries, grapes, apples, and clementines soaked in amarena cherry syrup (from Trader Joe's). The whipping cream was made from Country Crock Homestyle Dairy-Free plant cream. The clementines were a gift from my neighbor. This is a cake version of the <a href="https://addictedtodates.com/vegan-black-forest-cupcakes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Black Forest Cupcakes recipe</a> from Addicted to Dates, with a preheated oven set to 355° and baking for 18min as opposed to the recommended 22-25min, since the surface area was a lot wider. The goal of this project was to make a cake that wasn't so sweet.</p>

<p>Freehanded chocolate designs, inspired by the cupcakes from December 2025, along with henna and togepi's shell pattern from Pokemon. Piped designs were uneven due to it being made from melted chocolate as opposed to simply icing.</p>

<p>Thought gold might be a nice touch, along with wanting another excuse to paint with <a href="https://monegasquellc.com/products/gold-edible-food-grade-luster-dust" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">MONÉGASQUE</a> edible gold luster dust. I still have a lot of it and it will be a sad day when it runs out.</p>

<p>The cherry placement wasn't planned, but it was nice that the design so happened to have a spot to accommodate it.</p>
