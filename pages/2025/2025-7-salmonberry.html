<h2>Foraged Salmonberry Candycap Mushroom Cookies</h2>
<p>Although these aren't particularly pretty, they are VERY special cookies made from dried and mortar-and-pestle-ground candycap mushrooms (dried whole specimens purchased from Far West Fungi), along with a compote made from foraged salmonberries picked from the Oregon Coast. The salmonberries were foraged right at their yellowest and made into a compote with very little granulated organic cane sugar.</p>
