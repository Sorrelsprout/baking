<h2>New Year's Eve 2025 Cupcakes</h2>
<p>These doubled as cupcakes for a birthday party. The intent was to create cupcakes that had a magical-vintagey twist to them, hence the sun and moon graphics inspired by vintage solar symbols. Space has a vibe of ethereal endlessness to it, while a vintage aesthetic calls back to the past. Thought it would be a great way to represent a sense of "currentness" albeit subtley. Flavors made are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Vanilla Custard</li>
    <li>Chocolate Cherry Amaretto</li>
    <li>Chocolate Peanut Butter with PB Custard</li>
    <li>Pumpkin Spice Cold Brew</li>
</ul>
