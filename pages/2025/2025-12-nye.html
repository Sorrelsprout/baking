<h2>New Year's Eve 2025 Cupcakes</h2>
<p>These doubled as cupcakes for a birthday party. The tops of each cupcake were cut off to give a flatter surface for decoration. Flavors made are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Vanilla Custard</li>
    <li>Chocolate Cherry Amaretto</li>
    <li>Chocolate Peanut Butter with PB Custard</li>
    <li>Pumpkin Spice Cold Brew</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://www.noracooks.com/vanilla-vegan-frosting/#wprm-recipe-container-3879" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Vanilla Frosting</a> recipe from Nora Cooks was used as a base for all frostings.</p>
<p>The gold lettering was done by first making and piping the Easy Icing from Nora Cooks's <a href="https://www.noracooks.com/vegan-sugar-cookies/#recipe-1682-ingredients" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sugar Cookie Recipe</a> onto the iced cupcake surface. Then mixing the water-insoluble <a href="https://monegasquellc.com/products/gold-edible-food-grade-luster-dust" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">MONÉGASQUE</a> edible gold luster dust with water quickly to form a pasty paintable solution. The thickened paste was painted onto the iced letters/designs quickly, tiny bit by tiny bit, to make the designs shine. Water was used as a means to paint the powder onto the designs because the drying time was a lot faster and cleanup was easier. The powder also wasn't mixed with the icing itself because I felt like by painting on the powder, it would save on the amount of powder used, and give the designs themselves more oomph.</p>

<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p>The intent was to create cupcakes that had a magical-vintagey twist to them, hence the sun and moon graphics inspired by vintage solar symbols. Space has a vibe of ethereal endlessness to it, while a vintage aesthetic calls back to the past. Thought it would be a great way to represent a sense of "currentness" albeit subtley. I also wanted a darker color scheme for a cake base to contrast well with the gold that I knew I'd be using for lettering.</p>

<h3>Chocolate Cherry Amaretto</h3>
<p>This used an adjusted version of the <a href="https://addictedtodates.com/vegan-black-forest-cupcakes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Black Forest Cupcakes recipe</a> from Addicted to Dates. No Swiss Merengue Buttercream was used, and instead the frosting used an adjusted version of the vanilla frosting recipe referenced above.</p>

<h3>Vanilla Custard</h3>
<ul>
    <li>This used an adjusted <a href="https://lovingitvegan.com/vegan-vanilla-cupcakes-strawberry-vanilla-frosting/#recipe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Vanilla Cupcakes recipe</a> from Loving it Vegan. I didn't add the strawberries due to wanting a plainer flavor, and one of my friends having a strawberry allergy. The constraints for this project were good and felt manageable to work with.</li>
    <li>The <a href="https://www.noracooks.com/vegan-custard/#wprm-recipe-container-11800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Custard recipe</a> from Nora Cooks was used to make the filling for these.</li>
