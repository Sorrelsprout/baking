<h2>Fall Leaf Cookies</h2>
<p>Fall leaf cookies made for two occasions.</p>

<h3>Compassionate Thanksgiving 2025 Potluck</h3>
<p>Cookies made for the event hosted by <a href="https://nwveg.org/upcoming-events/2025-11-16-compassionate-thanksgiving-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">NW Veg</a>, inspired by a fallen leaf I found while walking to get home on a mid-day fall. I thought the leaf was beautifully vibrant, with such a unique color gradient, and I had the urge to make a muse of it. To get the stems and veins the deeper red-brown color, cocoa powder from the <a href="https://www.therealmrefillery.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Realm Refillery</a> was mixed into icing along with red food coloring. The <a href="https://www.noracooks.com/vegan-sugar-cookies/#wprm-recipe-container-1682" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">recipe</a> is an altered version from Nora Cooks, using oat milk, and maple syrup in place of both almond extract and corn syrup.</p>

<h3>Friend's Birthday Cookies</h3>
<p>Warm-toned Leaves for a friend's birthday in the height of fall, made a little earlier than the cookies above. The icing is more plain and the decor is dyed with food coloring.</p>
