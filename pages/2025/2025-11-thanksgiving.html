<h3>Compassionate Thanksgiving 2025 Potluck</h3>
<p>Cookies made for the event hosted by <a href="https://nwveg.org/upcoming-events/2025-11-16-compassionate-thanksgiving-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">NW Veg</a>, inspired by a fallen leaf I found while walking to get home on a mid-day fall. I thought the leaf was beautifully vibrant, with such a unique color gradient, and I had the urge to make a muse of it.</p>
